          <strong>Historical Background</strong>
          <p>
            As a way of addressing the critical problem of qualitative access to
            tertiary education, the Federal Ministry of Education decided to
            implement the extant government policy of equitable educational
            development of Nigeria, by establishing federal tertiary
            institutions in every State of the Federation, where they do not
            currently exist...
